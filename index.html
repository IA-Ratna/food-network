            <p>Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive
                function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research
                suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age. That doesn’t mean you
                have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your
                body gets all the essential protein it needs.</p>

            <p>Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be
                perfect,
                you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at
                once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.</p>

                    health, and boosting your mood.</p>
